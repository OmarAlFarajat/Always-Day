## Introduction
Developed by our team "Gargantua" and submitted for the week long [GJL Game Parade](https://itch.io/jam/gjl-game-parade-2020). The theme of the game jam was "Carpe Diem / Sieze the Day". 

## Description
  - **There are 3 zones. Red, Green and Blue.** Each color represents a shard of daylight stolen by day seizing ghosts. 
  - **Navigate the paths, platforms and environment hazards.** Do not fall out-of-bounds or you will dieâ€”but you'll respawn at the nearest checkpoint! 
  - **A ghost boss awaits you at the end of each zone.** They each have a one-shot-kill attack and an ability that will impede your movement or stun you.  
  - **Hold left-click above the ghosts while dodging their attacks.** When the stun meter fills up, they will be momentarily stunned for you to retrieve the light.
  - **Approach the obelisks guarded by the ghosts to gradually absorb the light shard.** Once you've absorbed all the light, you'll  teleport back to the starting point and can continue on to the next zone. Completed zones will be blocked off.
  - **You win the game when all 3 daylight shards have been retrieved.** The main obelisk at the start location will be lit with each color, indicating that you have successfully seized back the day!
